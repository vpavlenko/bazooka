Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history,\n    and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer\n    of books above the books in front. And it still isn\'t enough. Books\n    are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little\n    heaps under the windows.</p>\n    <p>This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent\n    Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia\n    Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James\n    Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>\n    <p>There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an\n    unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <em>Mr. H.\n    Potter</em> in emerald-green ink.</p>\n    <p>The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other,\n    but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be\n    uncivilised.</p>\n    <p>"You\'re joking," Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated\n    that he was very much afraid that she was serious.</p>\n    <p>"My sister was a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked\n    frightened, but stood her ground. "Her husband was a wizard."</p>\n    <p>"This is absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They were at our\n    wedding - they visited for Christmas -"</p>\n    <p>"I told them you weren\'t to know," Petunia whispered. "But it\'s\n    true. I\'ve seen things -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled his eyes. "Dear, I understand that you\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they\n    could always guess what you were thinking, that\'s called cold\n    reading -"</p>\n    <p>"It wasn\'t bending spoons -"</p>\n    <p>"What was it, then?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia bit her lip. "I can\'t just tell you. You\'ll think I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I wasn\'t - always like this -" She\n    gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily\n    did this. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I\n    begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, and\n    I\'d... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can you imagine how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gathering in Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,\n    or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I\n    hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\n    and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kind of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out\n    in front of me, and I couldn\'t stand it. And I wrote to my sister\n    and told her that if she didn\'t help me I\'d rather just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told\n    me it was dangerous, and I said I didn\'t care any more, and I drank\n    this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin\n    cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "and after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    her magic brought her in the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, you gained some\n    weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own.\n    Or being sick made you change your diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She was a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explain why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t win arguments with you, but please, you\n    have to trust me on this -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten there was a third person in the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>your</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convinced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then you don\'t have to fight over this," Harry said firmly.\n    Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    things just by arguing."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>you\'d</em> know better than to take this seriously, son, even\n    if you\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing\n    there is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn\'t\n    work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his\n    fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you\n    conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad,\n    look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. There\'s a quote there about how philosophers say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is\n    observation - that you just have to look at the world and report\n    what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t think of where\n    to find something about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His mother looked down at him and smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But\n    -" her head rose back up to stare at her husband. "I don\'t want to\n    win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen\n    to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed his eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of his\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now his parents were getting into one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel\n    guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," said his father, and his mother gave him a\n    reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to his bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behind him and tried to think.</p>\n    <p>The funny thing was, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum,\n    there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\n    something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being\n    insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the\n    universe really working like that.</p>\n    <p>Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic\n    was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter\n    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>\n    <p>Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. <em>Don\'t believe\n    everything you think,</em> one of his books had said.</p>\n    <p>But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just\n    <em>expecting</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\n    and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was\n    making no effort to guard itself against falsification - wasn\'t\n    making excuses in advance for why there wouldn\'t be a professor, or\n    the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>\n    <p><em>Where do you come from, strange little prediction?</em>\n    Harry directed the thought at his brain. <em>Why do I believe what\n    I believe?</em></p>\n    <p>Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in\n    this particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what his brain was\n    thinking.</p>\n    <p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords\n    pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to\n    do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.</p>\n    <p>He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started\n    writing.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress</em></p>\n    <p>Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another,\n    tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil.\n    This called for careful calligraphy.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</em></p>\n    <p><em>I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,\n    addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic\n    parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are\n    dead. I was adopted by Lily\'s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her\n    husband, Michael Verres-Evans.</em></p>\n    <p><em>I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional\n    on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she\n    knows about magic, and she can\'t use it herself. My father is\n    highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don\'t know where to\n    obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance\n    letter.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to\n    Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family\n    that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school\n    materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be\n    extremely helpful.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and\n    put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further\n    consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap\n    of the envelope, into which, using a penknife\'s tip, he impressed\n    the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this\n    madness, he was going to do it with style.</p>\n    <p>Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was\n    sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to\n    show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing\n    one of his father\'s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It\n    didn\'t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary\n    as arguments could be, <em>not arguing</em> was somehow much\n    worse.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said into the unnerving silence, "I\'m going to test\n    the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to\n    Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking\n    shocked. "I - I don\'t know, I think you just have to own a magic\n    owl."</p>\n    <p>That should\'ve sounded highly suspicious, <em>oh, so there\'s no\n    way to test your theory then,</em> but the peculiar certainty in\n    Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.</p>\n    <p>"Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I\'ll just\n    wave it around outside and call \'letter for Hogwarts!\' and see if\n    an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?"</p>\n    <p>His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. <em>Of\n    course,</em> Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful\n    thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so\n    far as to <em>test</em> the hypothesis, or even <em>watch</em> it\n    being tested, that would feel like <em>associating</em> himself\n    with that...</p>\n    <p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden,\n    did it occur to him that if an owl <em>did</em> come down and\n    snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad\n    about it.</p>\n    <p><em>But - well - that can\'t</em> really <em>happen, can it? No\n    matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down\n    and grabs this envelope, I\'m going to have worries a lot more\n    important than what Dad thinks.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the\n    air.</p>\n    <p>He swallowed.</p>\n    <p>Calling out <em>Letter for Hogwarts!</em> while holding an\n    envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden\n    was... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about\n    it.</p>\n    <p><em>No. I\'m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method\n    even if it makes me feel stupid.</em></p>\n    <p>"Letter -" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a\n    whispered croak.</p>\n    <p>Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky,\n    "<em>Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>"Harry?" asked a bemused woman\'s voice, one of the\n    neighbours.</p>\n    <p>Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the\n    envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was\n    hot with shame.</p>\n    <p>An old woman\'s face peered out from above the neighbouring\n    fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the\n    occasional babysitter. "What are you doing, Harry?"</p>\n    <p>"Nothing," Harry said in a strangled voice. "Just - testing a\n    really silly theory -"</p>\n    <p>"Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>Harry froze in place<em>.</em></p>\n    <p>"Yes," Harry\'s lips said a little while later. "I got a letter\n    from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but\n    -"</p>\n    <p>"But you don\'t <em>have</em> an owl. Poor dear! I can\'t imagine\n    <em>what</em> someone must have been thinking, sending you just the\n    standard letter."</p>\n    <p>A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an\n    expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over\n    his envelope.</p>\n    <p>"Just leave it to me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "and in a jiffy or\n    two I\'ll have someone over."</p>\n    <p>And her face disappeared from over the fence.</p>\n    <p>There was a long silence in the garden.</p>\n    <p>Then a boy\'s voice said, calmly and quietly, "What."</p>', '    <p>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase.

Each bookcase\n    has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history,\n    и everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer\n    of books above the books in front.

Books\n    are overflowing onto the tables и the sofas и making little\n    heaps under the windows.</p>\n    <p>This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent\n    Professor Michael Verres-Evans, и his wife, Mrs. Petunia\n    Evans-Verres, и their adopted son, Harry James\n    Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>\n    <p>There is a letter lying on the living-room table, и an\n    unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <em>Mr. H.\n    Potter</em> in emerald-green ink.</p>\n    <p>The Professor и his wife are speaking sharply at each other,\n    but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be\n    uncivilised.</p>\n    <p>"You\'re joking," Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated\n    that he was very much afraid that she was serious.</p>\n    <p>"My sister was a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked\n    frightened, but stood her ground. "Her husbи was a wizard."</p>\n    <p>"This is absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They were at our\n    wedding - they visited for Christmas -"</p>\n    <p>"I told them you weren\'t to know," Petunia whispered. "But it\'s\n    true. I\'ve seen things -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled his eyes. "Dear, I understи that you\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they\n    could always guess what you were thinking, that\'s called cold\n    reading -"</p>\n    <p>"It wasn\'t bending spoons -"</p>\n    <p>"What was it, then?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia bit her lip. "I can\'t just tell you. You\'ll think I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I wasn\'t - always like this -" She\n    gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily\n    did this. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I\n    begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to her, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can you imagine how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gathering in Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, и make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,\n    or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, и I\n    hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat и he was\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\n    и that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kind of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out\n    in front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it. And I wrote to my sister\n    и told her that if she didn\'t help me I\'d rather just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told\n    me it was dangerous, и I said I didn\'t care any more, и I drank\n    this potion и I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin\n    cleared up и I finally filled out и... I was beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    her magic brought her in the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, you gained some\n    weight while resting in bed, и your skin cleared up on its own.\n    Or being sick made you change your diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She was a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explain why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung her hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t win arguments with you, but please, you\n    have to trust me on this -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten there was a third person in the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>your</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convinced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then you don\'t have to fight over this," Harry said firmly.\n    Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    here и see the magic for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    things just by arguing."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>you\'d</em> know better than to take this seriously, son, even\n    if you\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing\n    there is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his\n    fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if you\n    conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad,\n    look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. There\'s a quote there about how philosophers say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is\n    observation - that you just have to look at the world и report\n    what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t think of where\n    to find something about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His mother looked down at him и smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But\n    -" her head rose back up to stare at her husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    win an argument with your father. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to his wife who loves him, и trust her just this once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed his eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of his\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now his parents were getting into one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel\n    guilty, и his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," said his father, и his mother gave him a\n    reassuring kiss, и then they went on fighting while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to his bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behind him и tried to think.</p>\n    <p>The funny thing was, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of magic, и according to Mum,\n    there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\n    something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being\n    insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp.

I\'ve seen things -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled his eyes. "Dear, I understи that you\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they\n    could always guess what you were thinking, that\'s called cold\n    reading -"</p>\n    <p>"It былn\'t bending spoons -"</p>\n    <p>"What был it, then?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia bit her lip. "I can\'t just tell you. You\'ll think I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I былn\'t - always like this -" She\n    gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily\n    did this. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I\n    begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to her, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can you imagine how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gathering in Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, и make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,\n    or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, и I\n    hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    был going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he был fat и he был\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\n    и that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kind of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It был like I saw my whole future life stretching out\n    in front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it. And I wrote to my sister\n    и told her that if she didn\'t help me I\'d rather just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told\n    me it был dangerous, и I said I didn\'t care any more, и I drank\n    this potion и I был sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin\n    cleared up и I finally filled out и... I был beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    her magic brought her in the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, you gained some\n    weight while resting in bed, и your skin cleared up on its own.\n    Or being sick made you change your diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She был a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance был creeping into his\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explain why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung her hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t win arguments with you, but please, you\n    have to trust me on this -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten there был a third person in the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>your</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convinced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then you don\'t have to fight over this," Harry said firmly.\n    Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    here и see the magic for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    things just by arguing."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>you\'d</em> know better than to take this seriously, son, even\n    if you\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing\n    there is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He был treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he был provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his\n    fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He был given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if you\n    conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad,\n    look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. There\'s a quote there about how philosophers say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is\n    observation - that you just have to look at the world и report\n    what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t think of where\n    to find something about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His mother looked down at him и smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But\n    -" her head rose back up to stare at her husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    win an argument with your father. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to his wife who loves him, и trust her just this once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed his eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of his\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now his parents were getting into one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel\n    guilty, и his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," said his father, и his mother gave him a\n    reassuring kiss, и then they went on fighting while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to his bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behind him и tried to think.</p>\n    <p>The funny thing был, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of magic, и according to Mum,\n    there был a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\n    something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being\n    insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp. A little insanity был far, far less improbable than the\n    universe really working like that.</p>\n    <p>Except that some part of Harry был utterly convinced that magic\n    был real, и had been since the instant he saw the putative letter\n    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft и Wizardry.</p>\n    <p>Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. <em>Don\'t believe\n    everything you think,</em> one of his books had said.</p>\n    <p>But this bizarre certainty... Harry был finding himself just\n    <em>expecting</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\n    и wave a wи и magic would come out. The strange certainty был\n    making no effort to guard itself against falsification - былn\'t\n    making excuses in advance for why there wouldn\'t be a professor, or\n    the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>\n    <p><em>Where do you come from, strange little prediction?</em>\n    Harry directed the thought at his brain. <em>Why do I believe what\n    I believe?</em></p>\n    <p>Usually Harry был pretty good at answering that question, but in\n    this particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what his brain был\n    thinking.</p>\n    <p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords\n    pushing, и a hиle on a door affords pulling, и the thing to\n    do with a testable hypothesis is to go и test it.</p>\n    <p>He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, и started\n    writing.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress</em></p>\n    <p>Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another,\n    tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil.\n    This called for careful calligraphy.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</em></p>\n    <p><em>I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,\n    addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic\n    parents, James Potter и Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are\n    dead. I был adopted by Lily\'s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, и her\n    husbи, Michael Verres-Evans.</em></p>\n    <p><em>I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional\n    on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she\n    knows about magic, и she can\'t use it herself. My father is\n    highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don\'t know where to\n    obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance\n    letter.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to\n    Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family\n    that magic был real, и, I presume, help Lily obtain her school\n    materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be\n    extremely helpful.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter и\n    put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further\n    consideration led him to obtain a cиle и drip wax onto the flap\n    of the envelope, into which, using a penknife\'s tip, he impressed\n    the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he был going to descend into this\n    madness, he был going to do it with style.</p>\n    <p>Then he opened his door и went back downstairs. His father был\n    sitting in the living-room и reading a book of higher maths to\n    show how smart he был; и his mother был in the kitchen preparing\n    one of his father\'s favourite meals to show how loving she был. It\n    didn\'t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary\n    as arguments could be, <em>not arguing</em> был somehow much\n    worse.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said into the unnerving silence, "I\'m going to test\n    the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to\n    Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking\n    shocked. "I - I don\'t know, I think you just have to own a magic\n    owl."</p>\n    <p>That should\'ve sounded highly suspicious, <em>oh, so there\'s no\n    way to test your theory then,</em> but the peculiar certainty in\n    Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.</p>\n    <p>"Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I\'ll just\n    wave it around outside и call \'letter for Hogwarts!\' и see if\n    an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come и watch?"</p>\n    <p>His father shook his head minutely и kept on reading. <em>Of\n    course,</em> Harry thought to himself. Magic был a disgraceful\n    thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so\n    far as to <em>test</em> the hypothesis, or even <em>watch</em> it\n    being tested, that would feel like <em>associating</em> himself\n    with that...</p>\n    <p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden,\n    did it occur to him that if an owl <em>did</em> come down и\n    snatch the letter, he был going to have some trouble telling Dad\n    about it.</p>\n    <p><em>But - well - that can\'t</em> really <em>happen, can it? No\n    matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down\n    и grabs this envelope, I\'m going to have worries a lot more\n    important than what Dad thinks.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath, и raised the envelope into the\n    air.</p>\n    <p>He swallowed.</p>\n    <p>Calling out <em>Letter for Hogwarts!</em> while holding an\n    envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden\n    был... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about\n    it.</p>\n    <p><em>No. I\'m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method\n    even if it makes me feel stupid.</em></p>\n    <p>"Letter -" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a\n    whispered croak.</p>\n    <p>Harry steeled his will, и shouted into the empty sky,\n    "<em>Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>"Harry?" asked a bemused woman\'s voice, one of the\n    neighbours.</p>\n    <p>Harry pulled down his hи like it был on fire и hid the\n    envelope behind his back like it был drug money. His whole face был\n    hot with shame.</p>\n    <p>An old woman\'s face peered out from above the neighbouring\n    fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the\n    occasional babysitter. "What are you doing, Harry?"</p>\n    <p>"Nothing," Harry said in a strangled voice. "Just - testing a\n    really silly theory -"</p>\n    <p>"Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>Harry froze in place<em>.</em></p>\n    <p>"Yes," Harry\'s lips said a little while later. "I got a letter\n    from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but\n    -"</p>\n    <p>"But you don\'t <em>have</em> an owl. Poor dear! I can\'t imagine\n    <em>what</em> someone must have been thinking, sending you just the\n    stиard letter."</p>\n    <p>A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, и opened an\n    expectant hи. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over\n    his envelope.</p>\n    <p>"Just leave it to me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "и in a jiffy or\n    two I\'ll have someone over."</p>\n    <p>And her face disappeared from over the fence.</p>\n    <p>There был a long silence in the garden.</p>\n    <p>Then a boy\'s voice said, calmly и quietly, "What."</p>', '    <p>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase\n    has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, егоtory,\n    и everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer\n    of books above the books in front.

Each bookcase\n    has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, егоtory,\n    и everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that ты can see the back layer\n    of books above the books in front.

The Professor considers shouting to be\n    uncivilised.</p>\n    <p>"You\'re joking," Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated\n    that he был very much afraid that she был serious.</p>\n    <p>"My sister был a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked\n    frightened, but stood her ground. "Her husbи был a wizard."</p>\n    <p>"Tего is absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They were at our\n    wedding - they visited for Christmas -"</p>\n    <p>"I told them ты weren\'t to know," Petunia wегоpered. "But it\'s\n    true. I\'ve seen things -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled его eyes. "Dear, I understи that ты\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons?

"I can\'t just tell ты. You\'ll think I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I былn\'t - always like tего -" She\n    gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily\n    did tего. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I\n    begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to her, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can ты imagine how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gathering in Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, и make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,\n    or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, и I\n    hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    был going out with tего boy, Vernon Dursley, he был fat и he был\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\n    и that его first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kind of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It был like I saw my whole future life stretching out\n    in front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it. And I wrote to my sister\n    и told her that if she didn\'t help me I\'d rather just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told\n    me it был dangerous, и I said I didn\'t care any more, и I drank\n    tего potion и I был sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin\n    cleared up и I finally filled out и... I был beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    her magic brought her in the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "ты got sick, ты gained some\n    weight while resting in bed, и тыr skin cleared up on its own.\n    Or being sick made ты change тыr diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She был a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance был creeping into его\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explain why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung her hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t win arguments with ты, but please, ты\n    have to trust me on tего -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten there был a third person in the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>тыr</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one in тыr family knew about magic when Lily got her\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convinced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then ты don\'t have to fight over tего," Harry said firmly.\n    Hoping against hope that tего time, just tего once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    here и see the magic for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    things just by arguing."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>ты\'d</em> know better than to take tего seriously, son, even\n    if ты\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing\n    there is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He был treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he был provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught его attention, bought all the books that caught его\n    fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He был given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if ты\n    conceived of тыrself as a Good Parent, ты would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at его father.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said. "If ты want to win tего argument with Dad,\n    look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. There\'s a quote there about how philosophers say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is\n    observation - that ты just have to look at the world и report\n    what ты see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t think of where\n    to find something about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His mother looked down at him и smiled. "Thank ты, Harry. But\n    -" her head rose back up to stare at her husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    win an argument with тыr father. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to его wife who loves him, и trust her just tего once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed его eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of его\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now его parents were getting into one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments again, one where его mother tried to make его father feel\n    guilty, и его father tried to make его mother feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about tего,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," said его father, и его mother gave him a\n    reassuring kiss, и then they went on fighting while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to его bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behind him и tried to think.</p>\n    <p>The funny thing был, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of magic, и according to Mum,\n    there был a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\n    something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being\n    insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp. A little insanity был far, far less improbable than the\n    universe really working like that.</p>\n    <p>Except that some part of Harry был utterly convinced that magic\n    был real, и had been since the instant he saw the putative letter\n    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft и Wizardry.</p>\n    <p>Harry rubbed его forehead, grimacing. <em>Don\'t believe\n    everything ты think,</em> one of его books had said.</p>\n    <p>But tего bizarre certainty... Harry был finding himself just\n    <em>expecting</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\n    и wave a wи и magic would come out. The strange certainty был\n    making no effort to guard itself against falsification - былn\'t\n    making excuses in advance for why there wouldn\'t be a professor, or\n    the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>\n    <p><em>Where do ты come from, strange little prediction?</em>\n    Harry directed the thought at его brain. <em>Why do I believe what\n    I believe?</em></p>\n    <p>Usually Harry был pretty good at answering that question, but in\n    tего particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what его brain был\n    thinking.</p>\n    <p>Harry mentally shrugged.

"I can\'t just tell ты. You\'ll thвk I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I былn\'t - always like tего -" She\n    gestured at herself, as though to вdicate her lithe form. "Lily\n    did tего. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> her. For years, I\n    begged her. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to her, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can ты imagвe how I felt?

And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    был goвg out with tего boy, Vernon Dursley, he был fat и he был\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\n    и that его first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kвd of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It был like I saw my whole future life stretchвg out\n    в front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it.

I был beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," her voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    her magic brought her в the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darlвg," Michael said gently, "ты got sick, ты gaвed some\n    weight while restвg в bed, и тыr skв cleared up on its own.\n    Or beвg sick made ты change тыr diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She был a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance был creepвg вto его\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explaв why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung her hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t wв arguments with ты, but please, ты\n    have to trust me on tего -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten there был a third person в the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>тыr</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia said, lookвg puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one в тыr family knew about magic when Lily got her\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convвced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then ты don\'t have to fight over tего," Harry said firmly.\n    Hopвg agaвst hope that tего time, just tего once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    here и see the magic for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    thвgs just by arguвg."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>ты\'d</em> know better than to take tего seriously, son, even\n    if ты\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thвg\n    there is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He был treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he был provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starvвg students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught его attention, bought all the books that caught его\n    fancy, sponsored в whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He был given anythвg reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teachвg\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if ты\n    conceived of тыrself as a Good Parent, ты would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at его father.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said. "If ты want to wв tего argument with Dad,\n    look в chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. There\'s a quote there about how philosophers say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule в science is that the fвal arbiter is\n    observation - that ты just have to look at the world и report\n    what ты see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t thвk of where\n    to fвd somethвg about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    thвgs by experiment вstead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His mother looked down at him и smiled. "Thank ты, Harry. But\n    -" her head rose back up to stare at her husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    wв an argument with тыr father. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to его wife who loves him, и trust her just tего once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed его eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of его\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now его parents were gettвg вto one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments agaв, one where его mother tried to make его father feel\n    guilty, и его father tried to make его mother feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m goвg to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about tего,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," said его father, и его mother gave him a\n    reassurвg kiss, и then they went on fightвg while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to его bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behвd him и tried to thвk.</p>\n    <p>The funny thвg был, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of magic, и accordвg to Mum,\n    there был a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\n    somethвg like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum jokвg, lyвg or beвg\n    вsane, в ascendвg order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    herself, that would explaв how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp. A little вsanity был far, far less improbable than the\n    universe really workвg like that.</p>\n    <p>Except that some part of Harry был utterly convвced that magic\n    был real, и had been sвce the вstant he saw the putative letter\n    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft и Wizardry.</p>\n    <p>Harry rubbed его forehead, grimacвg. <em>Don\'t believe\n    everythвg ты thвk,</em> one of его books had said.</p>\n    <p>But tего bizarre certaвty... Harry был fвdвg himself just\n    <em>expectвg</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\n    и wave a wи и magic would come out. The strange certaвty был\n    makвg no effort to guard itself agaвst falsification - былn\'t\n    makвg excuses в advance for why there wouldn\'t be a professor, or\n    the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>\n    <p><em>Where do ты come from, strange little prediction?</em>\n    Harry directed the thought at его braв. <em>Why do I believe what\n    I believe?</em></p>\n    <p>Usually Harry был pretty good at answerвg that question, but в\n    tего particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what его braв был\n    thвkвg.</p>\n    <p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords\n    pushвg, и a hиle on a door affords pullвg, и the thвg to\n    do with a testable hypothesis is to go и test it.</p>\n    <p>He took a piece of lвed paper from его desk, и started\n    writвg.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress</em></p>\n    <p>Harry paused, reflectвg; then discarded the paper for another,\n    tappвg another millimetre of graphite from его mechanical pencil.\n    Tего called for careful calligraphy.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress Mвerva McGonagall,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</em></p>\n    <p><em>I recently received тыr letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,\n    addressed to Mr. H.

If ты could do tего for my own family it would be\n    extremely helpful.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Sвcerely,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter и\n    put it в an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further\n    consideration led him to obtaв a cиle и drip wax onto the flap\n    of the envelope, вto which, usвg a penknife\'s tip, he impressed\n    the вitials H.J.P.E.V. If he был goвg to descend вto tего\n    madness, he был goвg to do it with style.</p>\n    <p>Then he opened его door и went back downstairs. His father был\n    sittвg в the livвg-room и readвg a book of higher maths to\n    show how smart he был; и его mother был в the kitchen preparвg\n    one of его father\'s favourite meals to show how lovвg she был. It\n    didn\'t look like they were talkвg to one another at all. As scary\n    as arguments could be, <em>not arguвg</em> был somehow much\n    worse.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry said вto the unnervвg silence, "I\'m goвg to test\n    the hypothesis. Accordвg to тыr theory, how do I send an owl to\n    Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>His mother turned from the kitchen sвk to stare at him, lookвg\n    shocked. "I - I don\'t know, I thвk ты just have to own a magic\n    owl."</p>\n    <p>That should\'ve sounded highly suspicious, <em>oh, so there\'s no\n    way to test тыr theory then,</em> but the peculiar certaвty в\n    Harry seemed willвg to stick its neck out even further.</p>\n    <p>"Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I\'ll just\n    wave it around outside и call \'letter for Hogwarts!\' и see if\n    an owl picks it up. Dad, do ты want to come и watch?"</p>\n    <p>His father shook его head mвutely и kept on readвg. <em>Of\n    course,</em> Harry thought to himself. Magic был a disgraceful\n    thвg that only stupid people believed в; if его father went so\n    far as to <em>test</em> the hypothesis, or even <em>watch</em> it\n    beвg tested, that would feel like <em>associatвg</em> himself\n    with that...</p>\n    <p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, вto the back garden,\n    did it occur to him that if an owl <em>did</em> come down и\n    snatch the letter, he был goвg to have some trouble tellвg Dad\n    about it.</p>\n    <p><em>But - well - that can\'t</em> really <em>happen, can it?

If an owl really comes down\n    и grabs tего envelope, I\'m goвg to have worries a lot more\n    important than what Dad thвks.</em></p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath, и raised the envelope вto the\n    air.</p>\n    <p>He swallowed.</p>\n    <p>Callвg out <em>Letter for Hogwarts!</em> while holdвg an\n    envelope high в the air в the middle of тыr own back garden\n    был... actually pretty embarrassвg, now that he thought about\n    it.</p>\n    <p><em>No. I\'m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method\n    even if it makes me feel stupid.</em></p>\n    <p>"Letter -" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a\n    wегоpered croak.</p>\n    <p>Harry steeled его will, и shouted вto the empty sky,\n    "<em>Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>"Harry?" asked a bemused woman\'s voice, one of the\n    neighbours.</p>\n    <p>Harry pulled down его hи like it был on fire и hid the\n    envelope behвd его back like it был drug money. His whole face был\n    hot with shame.</p>\n    <p>An old woman\'s face peered out from above the neighbourвg\n    fence, grizzled grey hair escapвg from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the\n    occasional babysitter. "What are ты doвg, Harry?"</p>\n    <p>"Nothвg," Harry said в a strangled voice. "Just - testвg a\n    really silly theory -"</p>\n    <p>"Did ты get тыr acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>Harry froze в place<em>.</em></p>\n    <p>"Yes," Harry\'s lips said a little while later. "I got a letter\n    from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but\n    -"</p>\n    <p>"But ты don\'t <em>have</em> an owl. Poor dear! I can\'t imagвe\n    <em>what</em> someone must have been thвkвg, sendвg ты just the\n    stиard letter."</p>\n    <p>A wrвkled arm stretched out over the fence, и opened an\n    expectant hи. Hardly even thвkвg at tего poвt, Harry gave over\n    его envelope.</p>\n    <p>"Just leave it to me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "и в a jiffy or\n    two I\'ll have someone over."</p>\n    <p>And her face disappeared from over the fence.</p>\n    <p>There был a long silence в the garden.</p>\n    <p>Then a boy\'s voice said, calmly и quietly, "What."</p>', '    <p>Every вch of wall space is covered by a bookcase.

Each bookcase\n    has six shelves, goвg almost to the ceilвg. Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, егоtory,\n    и everythвg else. Otеё shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that ты can see the back layer\n    of books above the books в front. And it still isn\'t enough. Books\n    are overflowвg onto the tables и the sofas и makвg little\n    heaps under the wвdows.</p>\n    <p>Tего is the livвg-room of the house occupied by the emвent\n    Professor Michael Verres-Evans, и его wife, Mrs. Petunia\n    Evans-Verres, и their adopted son, Harry James\n    Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>\n    <p>Tеёe is a letter lyвg on the livвg-room table, и an\n    unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <em>Mr. H.\n    Potter</em> в emerald-green вk.</p>\n    <p>The Professor и его wife are speakвg sharply at each otеё,\n    but they are not shoutвg. The Professor considers shoutвg to be\n    uncivilised.</p>\n    <p>"You\'re jokвg," Michael сказал to Petunia. His tone вdicated\n    that he был very much afraid that she был serious.</p>\n    <p>"My sister был a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked\n    frightened, but stood её ground. "Her husbи был a wizard."</p>\n    <p>"Tего is absurd!" Michael сказал sharply. "They were at our\n    weddвg - they visited for Christmas -"</p>\n    <p>"I told them ты weren\'t to know," Petunia wегоpered. "But it\'s\n    true. I\'ve seen thвgs -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled его eyes. "Dear, I understи that ты\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a traвed magician to fake the seemвgly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons?

"I can\'t just tell ты. You\'ll thвk I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I былn\'t - always like tего -" She\n    gestured at еёself, as though to вdicate её lithe form. "Lily\n    did tего. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> её. For years, I\n    begged её. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to её, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>magic,</em> can ты imagвe how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    её to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have её magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gatеёвg в Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, и make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to её sister,\n    or a centaur told её not to - the most ridiculous thвgs, и I\n    hated её for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    был goвg out with tего boy, Vernon Dursley, he был fat и he был\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he сказал he wanted children,\n    и that его first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kвd of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It был like I saw my whole future life stretchвg out\n    в front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it. And I wrote to my sister\n    и told её that if she didn\'t help me I\'d ratеё just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia сказал, её voice small, "she gave в. She told\n    me it был dangerous, и I сказал I didn\'t care any more, и I drank\n    tего potion и I был sick for weeks, but when I got better my skв\n    cleared up и I fвally filled out и... I был beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," её voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    её magic brought её в the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darlвg," Michael сказал gently, "ты got sick, ты gaвed some\n    weight while restвg в bed, и тыr skв cleared up on its own.\n    Or beвg sick made ты change тыr diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She был a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael сказал. The annoyance был creepвg вto его\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explaв why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung её hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t wв arguments with ты, but please, ты\n    have to trust me on tего -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten tеёe был a third person в the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>тыr</em> parents didn\'t\n    have magic, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia сказал, lookвg puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one в тыr family knew about magic when Lily got её\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convвced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia сказал. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some magic."</p>\n    <p>"Then ты don\'t have to fight over tего," Harry сказал firmly.\n    Hopвg agaвst hope that tего time, just tего once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    еёe и see the magic for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    thвgs just by arguвg."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>magic?</em> I thought\n    <em>ты\'d</em> know better than to take tего seriously, son, even\n    if ты\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thвg\n    tеёe is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He был treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fatеёs treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he был provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starvвg students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught его attention, bought all the books that caught его\n    fancy, sponsored в whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He был given anythвg reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teachвg\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if ты\n    conceived of тыrself as a Good Parent, ты would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at его fatеё.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry сказал. "If ты want to wв tего argument with Dad,\n    look в chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. Tеёe\'s a quote tеёe about how philosopеёs say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule в science is that the fвal arbiter is\n    observation - that ты just have to look at the world и report\n    what ты see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t thвk of wеёe\n    to fвd somethвg about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    thвgs by experiment вstead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His motеё looked down at him и smiled. "Thank ты, Harry. But\n    -" её head rose back up to stare at её husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    wв an argument with тыr fatеё. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to его wife who loves him, и trust её just tего once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed его eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of его\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now его parents were gettвg вto one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments agaв, one wеёe его motеё tried to make его fatеё feel\n    guilty, и его fatеё tried to make его motеё feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m goвg to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about tего,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," сказал его fatеё, и его motеё gave him a\n    reassurвg kiss, и then they went on fightвg while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to его bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behвd him и tried to thвk.</p>\n    <p>The funny thвg был, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad.

His whole face был\n    hot with shame.</p>\n    <p>An old woman\'s face peered out from above the neighbourвg\n    fence, grizzled grey hair escapвg from её hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the\n    occasional babysitter. "What are ты doвg, Harry?"</p>\n    <p>"Nothвg," Harry сказал в a strangled voice. "Just - testвg a\n    really silly theory -"</p>\n    <p>"Did ты get тыr acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>Harry froze в place<em>.</em></p>\n    <p>"Yes," Harry\'s lips сказал a little while later. "I got a letter\n    from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but\n    -"</p>\n    <p>"But ты don\'t <em>have</em> an owl. Poor dear! I can\'t imagвe\n    <em>what</em> someone must have been thвkвg, sendвg ты just the\n    stиard letter."</p>\n    <p>A wrвkled arm stretched out over the fence, и opened an\n    expectant hи. Hardly even thвkвg at tего poвt, Harry gave over\n    его envelope.</p>\n    <p>"Just leave it to me, dear," сказал Mrs. Figg, "и в a jiffy or\n    two I\'ll have someone over."</p>\n    <p>And её face disappeared from over the fence.</p>\n    <p>Tеёe был a long silence в the garden.</p>\n    <p>Then a boy\'s voice сказал, calmly и quietly, "What."</p>', '    <p>Every вch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase\n    has six shelves, goвg almost to the ceilвg. Some bookshelves are\n    stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, егоtory,\n    и everythвg else. Otеё shelves have two layers of paperback\n    science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\n    tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that ты can see the back layer\n    of books above the books в front. And it still isn\'t enough. Books\n    are overflowвg onto the tables и the sofas и makвg little\n    heaps under the wвdows.</p>\n    <p>Tего is the livвg-room of the house occupied by the emвent\n    Professor Michael Verres-Evans, и его wife, Mrs. Petunia\n    Evans-Verres, и their adopted son, Harry James\n    Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>\n    <p>Tеёe is a letter lyвg on the livвg-room table, и an\n    unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <em>Mr. H.\n    Potter</em> в emerald-green вk.</p>\n    <p>The Professor и его wife are speakвg sharply at each otеё,\n    but they are not shoutвg. The Professor considers shoutвg to be\n    uncivilised.</p>\n    <p>"You\'re jokвg," Michael сказал to Petunia. His tone вdicated\n    that he был very much afraid that she был serious.</p>\n    <p>"My sister был a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked\n    frightened, but stood её ground. "Her husbи был a wizard."</p>\n    <p>"Tего is absurd!" Michael сказал sharply. "They were at our\n    weddвg - they visited for Christmas -"</p>\n    <p>"I told them ты weren\'t to know," Petunia wегоpered. "But it\'s\n    true. I\'ve seen thвgs -"</p>\n    <p>The Professor rolled его eyes. "Dear, I understи that ты\'re\n    not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\n    easy it is for a traвed магияian to fake the seemвgly impossible.\n    Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they\n    could always guess what ты were thвkвg, that\'s called cold\n    readвg -"</p>\n    <p>"It былn\'t bendвg spoons -"</p>\n    <p>"What был it, then?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia bit её lip. "I can\'t just tell ты. You\'ll thвk I\'m -"\n    She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I былn\'t - always like tего -" She\n    gestured at еёself, as though to вdicate её lithe form. "Lily\n    did tего. Because I - because I <em>begged</em> её. For years, I\n    begged её. Lily had <em>always</em> been prettier than me, и\n    I\'d... been mean to её, because of that, и then she got\n    <em>магия,</em> can ты imagвe how I felt? And I <em>begged</em>\n    её to use some of that магия on me so that I could be pretty too,\n    even if I couldn\'t have её магия, at least I could be pretty."</p>\n    <p>Tears were gatеёвg в Petunia\'s eyes.</p>\n    <p>"And Lily would tell me no, и make up the most ridiculous\n    excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to её sister,\n    or a centaur told её not to - the most ridiculous thвgs, и I\n    hated её for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\n    был goвg out with tего boy, Vernon Dursley, he был fat и he был\n    the only boy who would talk to me. And he сказал he wanted children,\n    и that его first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\n    myself, <em>what kвd of parent names their child Dudley\n    Dursley?</em> It был like I saw my whole future life stretchвg out\n    в front of me, и I couldn\'t stи it. And I wrote to my sister\n    и told её that if she didn\'t help me I\'d ratеё just -"</p>\n    <p>Petunia stopped.</p>\n    <p>"Anyway," Petunia сказал, её voice small, "she gave в. She told\n    me it был dangerous, и I сказал I didn\'t care any more, и I drank\n    tего potion и I был sick for weeks, but when I got better my skв\n    cleared up и I fвally filled out и... I был beautiful, people\n    were <em>nice</em> to me," её voice broke, "и after that I\n    couldn\'t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\n    её магия brought её в the end -"</p>\n    <p>"Darlвg," Michael сказал gently, "ты got sick, ты gaвed some\n    weight while restвg в bed, и тыr skв cleared up on its own.\n    Or beвg sick made ты change тыr diet -"</p>\n    <p>"She был a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>\n    <p>"Petunia," Michael сказал. The annoyance был creepвg вto его\n    voice. "You <em>know</em> that can\'t be true. Do I really have to\n    explaв why?"</p>\n    <p>Petunia wrung её hиs. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n    "My love, I know I can\'t wв arguments with ты, but please, ты\n    have to trust me on tего -"</p>\n    <p>"<em>Dad! Mum!</em>\u202f"</p>\n    <p>The two of them stopped и looked at Harry as though they\'d\n    forgotten tеёe был a third person в the room.</p>\n    <p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <em>тыr</em> parents didn\'t\n    have магия, did they?"</p>\n    <p>"No," Petunia сказал, lookвg puzzled.</p>\n    <p>"Then no one в тыr family knew about магия when Lily got её\n    letter. How did <em>they</em> get convвced?"</p>\n    <p>"Ah..." Petunia сказал. "They didn\'t just send a letter. They sent\n    a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia\'s eyes flicked to Michael.\n    "He showed us some магия."</p>\n    <p>"Then ты don\'t have to fight over tего," Harry сказал firmly.\n    Hopвg agaвst hope that tего time, just tего once, they would\n    listen to him. "If it\'s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\n    еёe и see the магия for ourselves, и Dad will admit that it\'s\n    true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it\'s false. That\'s what\n    the experimental method is for, so that we don\'t have to resolve\n    thвgs just by arguвg."</p>\n    <p>The Professor turned и looked down at him, dismissive as\n    usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <em>магия?</em> I thought\n    <em>ты\'d</em> know better than to take tего seriously, son, even\n    if ты\'re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thвg\n    tеёe is!"</p>\n    <p>Harry\'s mouth twisted bitterly. He был treated well, probably\n    better than most genetic fatеёs treated their own children. Harry\n    had been sent to the best primary schools - и when that didn\'t\n    work out, he был provided with tutors from the endless pool of\n    starvвg students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\n    whatever caught его attention, bought all the books that caught его\n    fancy, sponsored в whatever maths or science competitions he\n    entered. He был given anythвg reasonable that he wanted, except,\n    maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teachвg\n    biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\n    advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\n    course; that\'s what a Good Parent would do, и so, if ты\n    conceived of тыrself as a Good Parent, ты would do it. But take a\n    ten-year-old <em>seriously?</em> Hardly.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at его fatеё.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry сказал. "If ты want to wв tего argument with Dad,\n    look в chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\n    Physics. Tеёe\'s a quote tеёe about how philosopеёs say a great\n    deal about what science absolutely requires, и it is all wrong,\n    because the only rule в science is that the fвal arbiter is\n    observation - that ты just have to look at the world и report\n    what ты see. Um... off the top of my head I can\'t thвk of wеёe\n    to fвd somethвg about how it\'s an ideal of science to settle\n    thвgs by experiment вstead of arguments -"</p>\n    <p>His motеё looked down at him и smiled. "Thank ты, Harry. But\n    -" её head rose back up to stare at её husbи. "I don\'t want to\n    wв an argument with тыr fatеё. I want my husbи to, to listen\n    to его wife who loves him, и trust её just tего once -"</p>\n    <p>Harry closed его eyes briefly. <em>Hopeless.</em> Both of его\n    parents were just hopeless.</p>\n    <p>Now его parents were gettвg вto one of <em>those</em>\n    arguments agaв, one wеёe его motеё tried to make его fatеё feel\n    guilty, и его fatеё tried to make его motеё feel stupid.</p>\n    <p>"I\'m goвg to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice\n    trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about tего,\n    Mum, Dad, we\'ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>\n    <p>"Of course, Harry," сказал его fatеё, и его motеё gave him a\n    reassurвg kiss, и then they went on fightвg while Harry climbed\n    the stairs to его bedroom.</p>\n    <p>He shut the door behвd him и tried to thвk.</p>\n    <p>The funny thвg был, he <em>should</em> have agreed with Dad. No\n    one had ever seen any evidence of магия, и accordвg to Mum,\n    tеёe был a whole магияal world out tеёe. How could anyone keep\n    somethвg like that a secret? More магия? That seemed like a ratеё\n    suspicious sort of excuse.</p>\n    <p>It should have been a clean case for Mum jokвg, lyвg or beвg\n    вsane, в ascendвg order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\n    еёself, that would explaв how it arrived at the letterbox without\n    a stamp. A little вsanity был far, far less improbable than the\n    universe really workвg like that.</p>\n    <p>Except that some part of Harry был utterly convвced that магия\n    был real, и had been sвce the вstant he saw the putative letter\n    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft и Wizardry.</p>\n    <p>Harry rubbed его forehead, grimacвg. <em>Don\'t believe\n    everythвg ты thвk,</em> one of его books had сказал.</p>\n    <p>But tего bizarre certaвty... Harry был fвdвg himself just\n    <em>expectвg</em> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\n    и wave a wи и магия would come out. The strange certaвty был\n    makвg no effort to guard itself agaвst falsification - былn\'t\n    makвg excuses в advance for why tеёe wouldn\'t be a professor, or\n    the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>\n    <p><em>Wеёe do ты come from, strange little prediction?</em>\n    Harry directed the thought at его braв. <em>Why do I believe what\n    I believe?</em></p>\n    <p>Usually Harry был pretty good at answerвg that question, but в\n    tего particular case, he had no <em>clue</em> what его braв был\n    thвkвg.</p>\n    <p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords\n    pushвg, и a hиle on a door affords pullвg, и the thвg to\n    do with a testable hypothesis is to go и test it.</p>\n    <p>He took a piece of lвed paper from его desk, и started\n    writвg.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress</em></p>\n    <p>Harry paused, reflectвg; then discarded the paper for anotеё,\n    tappвg anotеё millimetre of graphite from его mechanical pencil.\n    Tего called for careful calligraphy.</p>\n    <p><em>Dear Deputy Headmistress Mвerva McGonagall,</em></p>\n    <p><em>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</em></p>\n    <p><em>I recently received тыr letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,\n    addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic\n    parents, James Potter и Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are\n    dead. I был adopted by Lily\'s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, и её\n    husbи, Michael Verres-Evans.</em></p>\n    <p><em>I am extremely вterested в attendвg Hogwarts, conditional\n    on such a place actually existвg. Only my motеё Petunia says she\n    knows about магия, и she can\'t use it еёself. My fatеё is\n    highly sceptical. I myself am uncertaв. I also don\'t know wеёe to\n    obtaв any of the books or equipment listed в тыr acceptance\n    letter.</em></p>\n    <p><em>Motеё mentioned that ты sent a Hogwarts representative to\n    Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) в order to demonstrate to её family\n    that магия был real, и, I presume, help Lily obtaв её school\n    materials.

Furtеё\n    consideration led him to obtaв a cиle и drip wax onto the flap\n    of the envelope, вto which, usвg a penknife\'s tip, he impressed\n    the вitials H.J.P.E.V. If he был goвg to descend вto tего\n    madness, he был goвg to do it with style.</p>\n    <p>Then he opened его door и went back downstairs. His fatеё был\n    sittвg в the livвg-room и readвg a book of higеё maths to\n    show how smart he был; и его motеё был в the kitchen preparвg\n    one of его fatеё\'s favourite meals to show how lovвg she был. It\n    didn\'t look like they were talkвg to one anotеё at all. As scary\n    as arguments could be, <em>not arguвg</em> был somehow much\n    worse.</p>\n    <p>"Mum," Harry сказал вto the unnervвg silence, "I\'m goвg to test\n    the hypothesis. Accordвg to тыr theory, how do I send an owl to\n    Hogwarts?"</p>\n    <p>His motеё turned from the kitchen sвk to stare at him, lookвg\n    shocked. "I - I don\'t know, I thвk ты just have to own a магия\n    owl."</p>\n    <p>That should\'ve sounded highly suspicious, <em>oh, so tеёe\'s no\n    way to test тыr theory then,</em> but the peculiar certaвty в\n    Harry seemed willвg to stick its neck out even furtеё.</p>\n    <p>"Well, the letter got еёe somehow," Harry сказал, "so I\'ll just\n    wave it around outside и call \'letter for Hogwarts!\' и see if\n    an owl picks it up. Dad, do ты want to come и watch?"</p>\n    <p>His fatеё shook его head mвutely и kept on readвg. <em>Of\n    course,</em> Harry thought to himself. Magic был a disgraceful\n    thвg that only stupid people believed в; if его fatеё went so\n    far as to <em>test</em> the hypothesis, or even <em>watch</em> it\n    beвg tested, that would feel like <em>associatвg</em> himself\n    with that...</p>\n    <p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, вto the back garden,\n    did it occur to him that if an owl <em>did</em> come down и\n    snatch the letter, he был goвg to have some trouble tellвg Dad\n    about it.</p>\n    <p><em>But - well - that can\'t</em> really <em>happen, can it?
